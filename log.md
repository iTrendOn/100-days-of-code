# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
- Downloaded and installed [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), Setup GitHub, Forked 100-days-of-code repository, review README file, website, FAQ, rules, etc.
- Installed Anaconda and created several environments for the course (tpq)/blog-website (pelican)/slides (rise).
- Installed Jupyter notebook.
- Executed/reviewed Jupyter notebook for [Mathematics Basics 01](https://base.pqp.io/base/po/get_training_html?tr_id=137)
- Created a new notebook for "Mathematics & Python Review".
- Reviewed [Python Cheatsheet](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/)
-

**Thoughts:** I really struggled to start with the challenge and organize myself, but, overall, I feel like this is the only way to refresh rusted skills and keep the pace with the large amount of material to cover during the course.

<!-- ### Day 2: May 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
