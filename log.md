# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
- Downloaded and installed [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), Setup GitHub, Forked 100-days-of-code repository, review README file, website, FAQ, rules, etc.
- Installed Anaconda and created several environments for the course (tpq)/blog-website (pelican)/slides (rise).
- Installed Jupyter notebook.
- Executed/reviewed Jupyter notebook for [Mathematics Basics 01](https://base.pqp.io/base/po/get_training_html?tr_id=137)
- Created a new notebook for "Mathematics & Python Review".
- Reviewed [Python Cheatsheet](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/)
-

**Thoughts:**
- I really struggled to start with the challenge and organize myself, but, overall, I feel like this is the only way to refresh rusted skills and keep the pace with the large amount of material to cover during the course.

### Day 2: May 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
- Installed [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) in one of my Anaconda environments.
- Installed [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/getting_started.html) and [Pandas-Datareader](https://pandas-datareader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#quick-start).
- Started to work on a program to connect to [Binance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance) cryptocurrency exchange. - This first App was based in several YouTube videos:
-- [Python Binance API, Dashboards & Data Science Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHqEPNgpbzQ).
-- [Binance API Tutorial in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uxAn7EBSS0)

**Thoughts**:
- I need to continue with basic tutorials and build the habit of coding every day (at least 1 hour). Not easy. I work on a technical field/environment (ERP Software) but not as a developer, so is really hard for me to work on coding stuff after my workday ends.
- Watched some interesting videos about the "Perfect Portfolio" including models/theories as [Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp), whick could be nice to apply to crypto. I hope we cover this during the course.

- In addition to [The Python Quants](https://home.tpq.io/certificates/) certificates programs, I need to review and consider during the practical (coding) excercises the material for the [MFIA](https://www.institutobme.es/esp/FIA/AcercaDe/QueEs.aspx) certification.

**Today's Progress**:
- Installed [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/getting-started/) and [Binance-Python](https://python-binance.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html).
- Splitted yesterday's app in two Jupyter notebooks: one for the Yahoo and one for the Binance API [Binance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance).
- Still following these videos:
-- [Python Binance API, Dashboards & Data Science Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHqEPNgpbzQ).
-- [Binance API Tutorial in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uxAn7EBSS0)

**Thoughts**:
- Continued working with basic Python tutorials and building the habit of daly programming.

<!-- ### Day 3: May 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

**Link(s) to work**
1. [Find the Longest Word in a String](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/find-the-longest-word-in-a-string)
2. [Title Case a Sentence](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/title-case-a-sentence) -->

<!-- ### Day 4: May 24, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
